Automatic Detection of diabetic retinopathy using Deep Learning

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a serious complication of diabetes that affects the eyes. It is caused by damage to the blood vessels in the retina and can lead to vision impairment or even blindness if not detected early. 
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of blindness globally, affecting individuals with diabetes. It results from damage to the blood vessels in the retina due to high blood sugar levels. 
There is a critical need for accessible, accurate, and efficient screening methods for DR. Early detection and treatment are essential to prevent the progression of the disease and to maintain visual health in patients.
